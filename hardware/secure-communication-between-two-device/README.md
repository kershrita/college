# Project Description
Using Arduino Nano and NRF24L01 module, we have created a secure connection between two devices, between them a distance determined by the type of the module, as the message is entered by the user through his laptop to the sender circuit, then the text entered into a simple equation to encrypt the text and convert it from plain text to cipher text, after which he sends the cipher text to the receiver circuit, when the receiver receives the cipher text, then he decrypts it by reversing the same encryption equation to become the decryption equation by using the same key when encrypting and decrypting the plain text. After decoding the text, the text before decoding and after decoding is displayed on the LCD screen.

This project is special than the rest of the other projects that I have done so far, as it contains an illustration of the circuit of the sender and the receiver i have made using Fritzing software, and a PCB drawing ready to print it using EasyEDA software. All of this you will find it in this folder.
