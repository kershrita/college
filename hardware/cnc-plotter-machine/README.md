# Project Description
Using Arduino Uno and a few resources, we have designed a CNC Plotter Machine that has the ability to draw with a pen via G-Code. This machine can draw with dimensions of 4 * 4 cm, and you can design a drawing machine with larger dimensions than these by enlarging the size of the x axis and y axis according to your requirements.
