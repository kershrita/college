# Project Description
Using the DTMF Module and Arduino Nano, we made a car robot that moves signals from the telecommunication network, so that we put a phone as a receiver in the car and another phone to enter into a call with the other phone in the car, and we send a number from 1 to 9 and according to this number that we send The car is moving.

Illustrative example: If we send a number 2, the other phone (the receiver) sends this value to the DTMF Module, then the DTMF Module converts it to binary number and sends it to the Arduino Nano and executes the required code of it if we press the number 2 and so on with the rest of the numbers.
